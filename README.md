# Implementation of "Matrix Capsules with EM Routing"

A TensorFlow implementation of Hinton's paper [Matrix Capsules with EM Routing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb) by [Perry Deng](https://github.com/PerryXDeng).

E-mail: [perry.deng@mail.rit.edu](mailto:perry.deng@mail.rit.edu)

This implementation experiments with modifications to Hinton's implementation, the main ones being:

1. affine instead of linear vote calculation
2. dropout and dropconnect capsule layers
3. detection of adversarial patches using reconstruction networks
